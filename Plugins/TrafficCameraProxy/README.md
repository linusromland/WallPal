# TrafficCameraProxy

The `TrafficCameraProxy` is a plugin that gets the latest image from a traffic camera. It is using [`Markussim's`](https://github.com/Markussim) (`traffic-cameras-server`)(https://github.com/Markussim/traffic-cameras-server) to get the latest image from a traffic camera.

You can specify the camera you want to get the image from by providing the camera's ID. It is also possible to change the server URL in the plugin config.
